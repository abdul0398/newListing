Consisting of 105 units across three 5-storey blocks, the boutique new launch condo offers a good range of facilities, such as a 30m leisure pool, spa pool, kid’s bubble pool, gym and fitness corner. Beyond the estate, its location in a mature district like Bukit Panjang provides residents access to plenty of amenities within walking distance, including Sheng Siong Supermarket, Junction 10 Mall, Hillion Mall and Bukit Panjang Plaza. It is also just 300m from Phoenix LRT station and 550m from Bukit Panjang MRT station, so residents can easily travel to the Central Business District (CBD) via the Downtown Line (DTL). With schools like Chua Chu Kang Secondary School, Jurong Pioneer Junior College and ITE College West nearby, it should benefit families with school-going children.",

Within the sprawling compound, there is a multitude of modern amenities available from swimming pools to games room, catering to the massive community. Residents can choose to lounge in the pool or on the pool deck, work out in the fitness gym or the tennis court, or relax and unwind in the sauna or jacuzzi. Beyond the development, there is no lack of food options nearby with Old Airport Road Food Centre in the neighbourhood. As Dakota MRT station is just a few minutes’ walk away, residents can easily travel across the island via Circle Line (CCL). There are also various renowned schools nearby, such as Kong Hwa Primary School, Chung Cheng High School (Main) and Tanjong Katong Girls' School, which is ideal for those with school-going children.",

Other than being close to a wide variety of media, biomedical and infocomm tech companies around the district with Mediapolis, Biopolis and Fusionopolis nearby, its strategic location is also highly accessible to public transportation as both Buona Vista MRT interchange and one-north station are within walking distance. There are also plenty of amenities around the area with Rochester Mall just across the street and The Star Vista less than a 10-minute walk away. Families with school-going children would appreciate popular schools like Fairfield Methodist Primary/Secondary School and Anglo-Chinese Junior College all within close proximity.",

Across Dairy Farm Road, nature-loving residents can take a scenic forest walk to Dairy Farm Nature Park, which connects to Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. Despite being located at the city fringe, off Upper Bukit Timah Road, residents can reach Hillview MRT station by foot in about 10 minutes, effectively linking them to downtown areas such as Bugis and Marina Bay via the Downtown Line (DTL). For more dining options, residents can also head to the nearby HillV2 or The Rail Mall, both within a 15-minute walk away. Schools like GESS International School, CHIJ Our Lady Queen Of Peace and Assumption English School are also within walking distance.",

Not only that, it is also integrated with the new Lentor MRT station, offering residents the ultimate convenience of travelling to places like Great World City and Orchard Boulevard via the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL). Featuring a double-volume Sky Terrace in each tower, where most of the facilities are, residents can take in the panoramic views of the surroundings while exercising in the sheltered, open-air fitness area, including the jogging track, yoga deck and infinity lap pool. For parties and gatherings, there is the Sky Terrace dining room with scenic views. For some quiet, alone time, there are pods and pavilions for residents to seek privacy and comfort in. Each facility is thoughtfully constructed to serve residents’ needs under all weather conditions.",

Located in Joo Chiat, the first Heritage Town in Singapore, Atlassia retains its Peranakan heritage at its core, with each unit designed in Art Deco style, combining the historical charm of the conserved shophouses with modern amenities. Take a stroll through the charming enclave and discover the numerous cuisines available in various restaurants, cafes and eateries in the area. The completion of the Tanjong Katong MRT station in 2023, which will be a 5-minute walk away, will also provide the convenience for residents to travel downtown to the Central Business District (CBD) via the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL). Otherwise, it is just a 10-minute drive to Marina Bay or CBD and a 15-minute drive to Changi Airport via the major expressways like East Coast Parkway (ECP), Marina Coastal Expressway (MCE) and Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE).",

Formerly an ethnic enclave of the Eurasians, the neighbourhood is rich in cultural history and influences, which can be seen from the beautifully refurbished heritage shophouses lining the streets and the numerous local delicacies available in this foodie haven, such as Eng’s Wanton Noodle, Nan Xiang Chicken Rice, Punggol Nasi Lemak and Zaffron Kitchen. Other food options in the area include hawker fare at the famous Old Airport Road Food Centre or Dunman Food Center, as well as the various trendy cafes and bistros dotted around the district. Royal Hallmark is also close to several shopping malls, such as Katong Shopping Centre, One KM and Katong V, satisfying all shopping needs. Located within a 15-minute walk to Dakota and Tanjong Katong MRT stations, residents can enjoy islandwide connectivity via the Circle Line (CCL) and Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL). As it is next door to Tanjong Katong Secondary School and near many other local schools like Tanjong Katong Primary, Tanjong Katong Girls' School and Haig Girls' School, Royal Hallmark is especially ideal for families with school-going children.",

        "description": "Home to 638 apartments, Leedon Green is a freehold new condo launch with 7 residential towers built on 320,000 square feet of land. Within the extensive compound, there are pockets of verdant greenery that are beautifully manicured on undulating landscaped terraces to reflect natural landforms, perfectly capturing the tranquil resort vibe. Amongst the lush greenery, residents may find a myriad of amenities for their recreational needs, from wellness therapy pools and a yoga deck to social spaces like the Grand Dining Room, Forest BBQ Pavilion and Family Cabana on the Sky Terrace. Its ideal location on 1 Farrer Road in District 10, within the Core Central Region, also means that Orchard Road, the Central Business District (CBD) and even One-North are less than a 10-minute drive away. Nestled conveniently between Farrer Road and Holland Village MRT stations, both are within 1km walking distance from Leedon Green. Families with school-going children may benefit from prestigious schools, such as Nanyang Primary and Hwa Chong Institution, nearby as well.",

        "description": "Blending in with the Good Class Bungalows in its surroundings, Jervois Prive is a new launch 5-storey freehold condominium consisting of 45 units. Designed by highly acclaimed architect Yip Yuen Hong, also a four-time winner of the President’s Design Award, the luxury development pays homage to the heritage estate it resides on with its tropical brutalism architecture that is raw, basic and minimalist, yet lends a touch of contemporary sophistication for modern living. Softening its concrete exterior with an abundance of greenery within, Jervois Prive is a verdant sanctuary for residents to immerse themselves in after a long day, whether by soaking in the Jacuzzi in Meadows or strolling through the Enchanted Garden. Located on 100A Jervois Road in prime District 10, it is less than 1km from Redhill MRT station and less than a 10-minute drive from Orchard Road and the Central Business District (CBD). Families with school-going children will also appreciate having schools like Alexandra Primary, Crescent Girls’, Queenstown Secondary and Gan Eng Seng School nearby.",
