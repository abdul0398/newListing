Beyond the estate, its location in a mature district like Bukit Panjang provides residents access to plenty of amenities within walking distance, including Sheng Siong Supermarket, Junction 10 Mall, Hillion Mall and Bukit Panjang Plaza. It is also just 300m from Phoenix LRT station and 550m from Bukit Panjang MRT station, so residents can easily travel to the Central Business District (CBD) via the Downtown Line (DTL). With schools like Chua Chu Kang Secondary School, Jurong Pioneer Junior College and ITE College West nearby, it should benefit families with school-going children.",

Other than being close to a wide variety of media, biomedical and infocomm tech companies around the district with Mediapolis, Biopolis and Fusionopolis nearby, its strategic location is also highly accessible to public transportation as both Buona Vista MRT interchange and one-north station are within walking distance. There are also plenty of amenities around the area with Rochester Mall just across the street and The Star Vista less than a 10-minute walk away. Families with school-going children would appreciate popular schools like Fairfield Methodist Primary/Secondary School and Anglo-Chinese Junior College all within close proximity.",

Across Dairy Farm Road, nature-loving residents can take a scenic forest walk to Dairy Farm Nature Park, which connects to Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. Despite being located at the city fringe, off Upper Bukit Timah Road, residents can reach Hillview MRT station by foot in about 10 minutes, effectively linking them to downtown areas such as Bugis and Marina Bay via the Downtown Line (DTL). For more dining options, residents can also head to the nearby HillV2 or The Rail Mall, both within a 15-minute walk away. Schools like GESS International School, CHIJ Our Lady Queen Of Peace and Assumption English School are also within walking distance.",

Not only that, it is also integrated with the new Lentor MRT station, offering residents the ultimate convenience of travelling to places like Great World City and Orchard Boulevard via the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL). Featuring a double-volume Sky Terrace in each tower, where most of the facilities are, residents can take in the panoramic views of the surroundings while exercising in the sheltered, open-air fitness area, including the jogging track, yoga deck and infinity lap pool. For parties and gatherings, there is the Sky Terrace dining room with scenic views. For some quiet, alone time, there are pods and pavilions for residents to seek privacy and comfort in. Each facility is thoughtfully constructed to serve residentsâ needs under all weather conditions.",

Located in Joo Chiat, the first Heritage Town in Singapore, Atlassia retains its Peranakan heritage at its core, with each unit designed in Art Deco style, combining the historical charm of the conserved shophouses with modern amenities. Take a stroll through the charming enclave and discover the numerous cuisines available in various restaurants, cafes and eateries in the area. The completion of the Tanjong Katong MRT station in 2023, which will be a 5-minute walk away, will also provide the convenience for residents to travel downtown to the Central Business District (CBD) via the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL). Otherwise, it is just a 10-minute drive to Marina Bay or CBD and a 15-minute drive to Changi Airport via the major expressways like East Coast Parkway (ECP), Marina Coastal Expressway (MCE) and Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE).",
